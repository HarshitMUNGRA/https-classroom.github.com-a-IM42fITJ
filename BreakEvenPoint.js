units of goods the company must manufacture and sell in order to break even: 
A. Assign the value 5000 to the variable fixed_costs.
B. Assign the value 8 to the variable price_per_unit.
C. Assign the value 6 to the variable cost_per_unit.
D. Assign the value fixed_costs divided by (the difference of price_per_unit and
cost_per_unit) to the variable break_even_point.
E. Display the value of the variable break_even_point in a console application.
